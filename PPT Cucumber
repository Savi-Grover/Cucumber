# Cucumber Framework 

## Minimum Requirements
1. OpenJDK 17
2. Gradle 8.5

## Introduction:

Behavior Driven Development
Behavior Driven testing is an extension of TDD. Like in TDD, we write tests first and the add application code in BDD as well. The major difference that we get to see here are

Tests are written in plain descriptive English type grammar Tests are explained as behavior of application and more user focused using examples to clarify requirements. This difference brings in the need to have a language which can define, in an understandable format.

## Features of BDD

	1. Collaboration between Business stakeholders, Business Analysts, QA Team and developers
	2. Ubiquitous language, it is easy to describe 
	3. Driven by Business Value 
	4. Extends Test Driven Development (TDD) by utilizing natural language that non technical stakeholders can understand  
	5. BDD frameworks such as Cucumber are an enabler, acting a “bridge” between Business & Technical Language

## What is Cucumber?

Cucumber is a testing framework which supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It lets us define application behavior in plain meaningful English text using a simple grammar defined by a language called Gherkin.
